# Test: Implement a Scroll View with Messages

## Requirements

Make a reusable Message component with different properties such as backgroundColor, cornerRadius, and textSize. The message should be universal and used for both photo and text messages.
Make an Input component to type and send messages, and send photos (the message should be saved in the database after sending).
Use the Room ORM to store messages.
Use XML or Jetpack Compose framework for the whole user interface.
Use MVVM design pattern.
Implement a scroll with pagination and configurable page size, with a default of 30 messages.
Push the code to a GitHub repository with a README on how to run the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build project.
3. Run on Android device / Emulator.
4. Fake data will be generated automatically.
5. Tap on Voice button to generate message from other people.
6. Write message and tap on Send button to send.
7. Attach images(maximum 10) and tap on send button. Wait few seconds(images will be cached to internal storage).
    Note - only one image is visible in UI.
8. Change Dark/Light modes. Both variants are implemented.
